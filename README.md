# Ticketing-System
WJEC Computing Project made through Java and incorporating MS Access. I chose to make a basketball club where customers would register and choose a seat(s) for specific games using a JFrame GUI.
A season ticket mechanism is also in place where customers would pay to reserve seats for every game of the season meaning no other customer could choose that seat. 
This was my A-Level project under taken from 2019-2020.
